# FileSystem
A tool I created for building, and accessing, a virtual disk written in c++ with complex file handling

Usage:

Vdisk.exe (or Vdisk for linux and macOs)

Vdisk add <filename> // add a file to the virtual img 

Vdisk read <filename> // read and sort from img by filename 

TO DO:

Deleting files lol... easy but i fell asleep and will add first thing

some type of encryption (Probably Aes)

listing all files by filenames in virtual image
