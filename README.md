# FileSystem
A tool I created for building, and accessing, a virtual disk written in c++ with complex file handling

Usage:

Vdisk.exe (or Vdisk for linux and macOs)

Vdisk add <filename> // add a file to the virtual img 

Vdisk read <filename> // read and sort from img by filename 

Vdisk list

Vdisk delete <path/on/img>

TO DO:

Deleting files lol... easy but i fell asleep and will add first thing (done)

some type of encryption (Probably Aes)

listing all files by filenames in virtual image (done)

add directories and list them and there path... will be done next
