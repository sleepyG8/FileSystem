# FileSystem
A tool I created for building, and accessing, a virtual disk written in c++ with complex file handling

Usage:

Vdisk.exe (or Vdisk for linux and macOs)

Vdisk add <filename> // add a file to the virtual img 

Vdisk read <filename> // read and sort from img by filename 

Vdisk list

Vdisk delete <path/on/img>

TO DO:

Deleting files lol... easy but i fell asleep and will add first thing (done)

listing all files by filenames in virtual image (done)

add directories, list them, and read directory file contents... will be done next (done)

make PE files executable, audio files playable, and pdfs viewable

some type of encryption (Probably Aes)
